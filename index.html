                <p>A Pool table game for 2 - 4 Players.</p>
                <p>Balls are placed in triangle for break as shown in the illustration: </p>
                <p>Player 1 then picks either Red or Yellow <br> 
                    (or bigs or smalls depending on ball set) and breaks.</p>
                <p>If Player 1 pots a ball of their chosen colour then they get another shot.<br>
                    The colour they chose on their first shot is still the colour they must pot.<br>
                    If they pot the opposite colour it is considered a foul.<br>
                    If they pot the black they lose and are out (also see tiebreaker).<br>
                    If they pot nothing it is then Player 2's turn.
                </p>
                <p>Player 2 then chooses a colour and play continues for each player<br>
                    until one colour of balls has been entirely potted. Then the player<br>
                    who potted the final ball of that colour can pot the black.<br>
                    However all other players may not pot the black until the alternate<br>
                    colour has been fully sunk. Once both colours are completely sunk<br>
                    all players may pot the black.
                </p>
                <p>When on black no fouls are penalised. To pot the black legally and win,<br>
                    a trickshot must be played. A trickshot is considered to be any shot that<br>
                    results in the black going in any pocket after either the white ball or<br>
                    black ball comes into contact with any cushion, or the black ball is potted<br>
                    off contact with another colour ball. For added difficulty, players may<br>
                    decide to call the pocket.
                </p>
                <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Fouls:</h2>
                <p>A foul is committed when a player:<br>
                    &nbsp a. Pots a ball opposite to their chosen colour;<br>
                    &nbsp b. Pots the black ball (this also results in elimination);<br>
                    &nbsp c. Pots the white ball (the white is then returned to the D);<br>
                    &nbsp d. Touches any ball with anything other than a cue;<br>
                    &nbsp e. Touches any ball with the cue other than the white ball;<br>
                    &nbsp f. or Knocks any ball off the table;<br>
                    A foul is penalised by the offending player missing their next turn.
                </p>
                <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Tiebreaker:</h2>
                <p>A tiebreaker occurs when the black ball is sunk prematurely (e.g. a foul) or<br>
                    the white ball is potted on the same shot as a legal black ball sink and<br>
                    therefore leaves more than one player still playing (on some tables this<br>
                    leaves the remaining players without access to the black ball, e.g. paid pub<br>
                    tables). <br>
                    To determine a single winner, the remaining players take turns (in reverse<br>
                    play order) attempting to pot the white ball from the top of the table (from<br>
                    the centre dot) off the back cushion, and back into either the left or right <br>
                    top pockets.
